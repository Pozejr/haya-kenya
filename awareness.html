            <h2>HIV Awareness</h2>
            <p>Increasing awareness about HIV/AIDS is essential for prevention, treatment, and support. This page provides detailed information to help you understand the basics of HIV, its transmission, prevention methods, treatment options, and the importance of ongoing education and support.</p>
            
            <h3>What is HIV?</h3>
            <p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight off infections. If left untreated, HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells, making the body more vulnerable to infections and certain cancers. Over time, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).</p>
            
            <h3>How is HIV Transmitted?</h3>
            <p>HIV can be transmitted through contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV. These fluids include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood</li>
                <li>Semen</li>
                <li>Vaginal fluids</li>
                <li>Rectal fluids</li>
                <li>Breast milk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most common ways HIV is transmitted include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person</li>
                <li>Sharing needles or syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood</li>
                <li>From mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding (vertical transmission)</li>
                <li>Rarely, through blood transfusion with contaminated blood (highly unlikely in areas where blood is screened for HIV)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How is HIV NOT Transmitted?</h3>
            <p>HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact. You cannot get HIV from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects (such as dishes, towels, or bedding)</li>
                <li>Air, water, or insect bites</li>
                <li>Sharing a toilet, shower, or swimming pool with a person living with HIV</li>
                <li>Closed-mouth kissing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>HIV Prevention Methods</h3>
            <p>Preventing HIV transmission is possible through various methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Condom Use:</strong> Using condoms correctly during sexual intercourse significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):</strong> PrEP is a daily medication for people at high risk of HIV that can reduce the risk of infection if taken consistently.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):</strong> PEP involves taking antiretroviral medicines after potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection. It must be started within 72 hours after the exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Testing:</strong> Regular HIV testing helps individuals know their status and seek timely treatment if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Needle Exchange Programs:</strong> These programs provide clean needles to people who inject drugs, reducing the risk of sharing contaminated needles.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment as Prevention (TasP):</strong> People living with HIV who take antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieve viral suppression (undetectable viral load) effectively have no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner (U=U).</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Comprehensive education on HIV transmission and prevention reduces stigma and promotes safer behaviors.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>HIV Testing and Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>HIV testing is the only way to know your HIV status. Types of tests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antibody Tests:</strong> These tests detect antibodies to HIV in the blood or oral fluid. Most rapid tests and home tests are antibody tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Combination Tests (Antibody/Antigen Tests):</strong> These tests detect both HIV antibodies and antigens (a part of the virus) in the blood.</li>
                <li><strong>Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs):</strong> These tests detect the presence of HIV in the blood by looking for the virus's genetic material (RNA). They can detect HIV sooner than other types of tests but are very expensive and not routinely used for screening.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for managing HIV and preventing transmission. Regular testing is recommended for people at high risk of HIV infection.</p>
            
            <h3>HIV Treatment Options</h3>
            <p>There is no cure for HIV, but it can be managed with effective treatment. The primary treatment for HIV is antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. The goals of ART are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the amount of HIV in the body (viral load)</li>
                <li>Maintain or increase CD4 cell count</li>
                <li>Prevent HIV-related illnesses and opportunistic infections</li>
                <li>Reduce the risk of HIV transmission</li>
                <li>Improve quality of life</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Adherence to the prescribed HIV regimen is crucial for the treatment to be effective. Regular follow-up care and monitoring are essential to manage any side effects and ensure the treatment's success.</p>
            
            <h3>Living with HIV</h3>
            <p>People living with HIV can lead healthy, fulfilling lives with proper treatment and support. Key aspects of managing life with HIV include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medical Care:</strong> Regular medical check-ups and monitoring of HIV status are essential. Working with a healthcare provider to manage the condition and any related health issues is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> HIV can impact mental health. Access to counseling, support groups, and mental health services can help manage stress, anxiety, and depression.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding substance abuse can improve overall health and well-being.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Systems:</strong> Building a network of supportive friends, family, and healthcare providers can provide emotional and practical support.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Advocacy:</strong> Staying informed about HIV and advocating for oneself and others living with HIV helps reduce stigma and promote better health outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Combating HIV-Related Stigma</h3>
            <p>Stigma and discrimination related to HIV can negatively impact mental health, access to care, and quality of life. Combating stigma involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Educating the public about HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment helps dispel myths and reduce fear and prejudice.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Promoting empathy and understanding towards people living with HIV fosters a supportive environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Advocating for policies and practices that protect the rights of people living with HIV and ensure equal access to healthcare and support services.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Educational Workshops and Resources</h3>
            <p>HIV Youth Alliance Kenya offers educational workshops and resources to increase awareness and knowledge about HIV. These workshops cover topics such as:</p>
