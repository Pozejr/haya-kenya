            <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is the cornerstone of HIV treatment. It involves using a combination of HIV medicines to effectively control the virus and improve immune function.</p>
            
            <h3>How ART Works</h3>
            <p>ART works by targeting different stages of the HIV lifecycle to prevent the virus from replicating and spreading in the body:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entry Inhibitors:</strong> Block HIV from entering CD4 cells, preventing infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTIs):</strong> Interfere with HIV's ability to replicate its genetic material.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrase Inhibitors:</strong> Block integrase, an enzyme that HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Protease Inhibitors:</strong> Prevent HIV from producing mature infectious viral particles.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>ART is typically prescribed as a combination of these medications, known as an ART regimen. This approach is called Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) to undetectable levels.</li>
                <li>Restore immune function by increasing CD4 cell counts.</li>
                <li>Prevent HIV-related complications and opportunistic infections.</li>
                <li>Reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Adherence to ART</h3>
            <p>Adherence to ART is crucial for its effectiveness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take medications exactly as prescribed, every day without missing doses.</li>
                <li>Follow-up regularly with healthcare providers for monitoring and adjustments.</li>
                <li>Report any side effects or challenges with adherence to healthcare providers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Managing Side Effects</h3>
            <p>ART may cause side effects, which can vary depending on the medications used. Common side effects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</li>
                <li>Headaches or dizziness.</li>
                <li>Changes in body fat distribution (lipodystrophy).</li>
                <li>Increased cholesterol or blood sugar levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Healthcare providers can help manage side effects and adjust treatment regimens as needed.</p>
            
            <h3>Drug Resistance</h3>
            <p>Drug resistance occurs when HIV mutates and becomes resistant to the antiretroviral medications used in treatment. Factors contributing to drug resistance include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inconsistent adherence to medication regimens.</li>
                <li>Incorrect use of medications, such as missing doses or not taking them as prescribed.</li>
                <li>Prolonged use of the same treatment regimen without monitoring viral load and CD4 counts.</li>
                <li>Pre-existing drug-resistant strains of HIV.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Healthcare providers monitor drug resistance through regular viral load tests and adjust treatment regimens accordingly.</p>
            
            <h3>Adherence Challenges</h3>
            <p>Adherence challenges can impact treatment effectiveness. Common reasons for adherence issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complex medication schedules.</li>
                <li>Side effects that affect quality of life.</li>
                <li>Stigma associated with HIV and its treatment.</li>
                <li>Access barriers to healthcare and medications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Support from healthcare providers, peer groups, and adherence counseling can help individuals overcome these challenges and adhere to their treatment plans.</p>
            
            <h3>Treatment Regimens</h3>
            <p>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) involves the use of combinations of HIV medicines to effectively control the virus and improve immune function. The regimens are categorized into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-Line ART Regimens:</strong> These are typically recommended as the initial treatment for people diagnosed with HIV. They are effective, well-tolerated, and have fewer side effects. Examples include Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Dolutegravir (DTG), Abacavir (ABC) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Dolutegravir (DTG), and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Bictegravir (BIC).</li>
                <li><strong>Second-Line ART Regimens:</strong> These are used when first-line treatments fail due to drug resistance or intolerability. They may involve different drug classes or combinations such as Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Atazanavir (ATV) + Ritonavir (RTV), Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Lopinavir (LPV) + Ritonavir (RTV), and Abacavir (ABC) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Darunavir (DRV) + Ritonavir (RTV).</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Line ART Regimens:</strong> These are used when second-line treatments fail or are not tolerated. They often include drugs from new classes or experimental treatments like Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Raltegravir (RAL) + Darunavir (DRV), Dolutegravir (DTG) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Atazanavir (ATV) + Ritonavir (RTV), and Darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c) + Raltegravir (RAL) + Emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each ART regimen is tailored based on individual factors such as viral load, CD4 count, drug resistance, and patient preferences. Regular monitoring and adherence are essential for successful HIV management.</p>
