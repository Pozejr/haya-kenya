            <h2>Testing Services</h2>
            <p>HIV Youth Alliance Kenya offers comprehensive HIV testing services to help individuals know their status and take the necessary steps to protect their health. Here are the details of our testing services:</p>
            
            <h3>Types of HIV Tests</h3>
            <p>We offer several types of HIV tests, each with its own benefits and specific use cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid HIV Tests:</strong> These tests provide results within 20-30 minutes and are ideal for quick screening. They can detect HIV antibodies in blood or oral fluid.</li>
                <li><strong>Laboratory-based HIV Tests:</strong> These tests, including ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) and Western blot, are performed in a lab and provide highly accurate results. They may take a few days to return results.</li>
                <li><strong>Home Testing Kits:</strong> These kits allow individuals to collect a sample at home and send it to a lab for testing. Results are usually available within a few days.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Detection Tests:</strong> These tests, such as nucleic acid tests (NAT), can detect HIV infection earlier than antibody tests by identifying the virus itself in the blood.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Testing Procedures</h3>
            <p>Understanding the testing process can help alleviate any concerns or fears. Here’s what to expect when you come for an HIV test:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pre-Test Counseling:</strong> Our trained counselors provide information about the test, what the results mean, and how to cope with the outcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample Collection:</strong> Depending on the type of test, a small blood sample or oral fluid sample will be collected.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> The sample is tested either on-site (for rapid tests) or sent to a laboratory for analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Results:</strong> For rapid tests, results are available within minutes. For lab-based tests, results are typically available within a few days.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Test Counseling:</strong> Regardless of the result, our counselors provide post-test counseling to discuss next steps, whether it’s preventive measures for a negative result or treatment and support for a positive result.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Importance of Regular Testing</h3>
            <p>Regular HIV testing is a crucial component of HIV prevention and treatment. Here’s why it’s important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Early diagnosis allows for prompt treatment, which can significantly improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of HIV transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive Measures:</strong> Knowing your status helps you take steps to protect your health and prevent the spread of HIV to others.</li>
                <li><strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Regular testing provides peace of mind and can alleviate the anxiety of not knowing your status.</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Being informed about your status empowers you to make informed decisions about your health and well-being.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Confidentiality and Privacy</h3>
